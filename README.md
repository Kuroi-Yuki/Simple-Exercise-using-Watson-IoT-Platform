# Simple-Exercise-using-Watson-IoT-Platform
This repository provides a simple exercise where temperature and humidity are collected from DHT11 sensor and sent to Watson IoT Platform service. If values of the temperature and humidity are outside a range, signal is sent through Watson IoT Platform service to alert the user (LED will light up). The visualization of the sensor data is also presented.
